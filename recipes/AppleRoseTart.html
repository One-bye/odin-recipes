    <h2> Description: </h2>
    <p>
        This Apple Tart is a looker! It's crowned with a beautiful rose pattern of sliced apples. 
        The juices from the cinnamon-sugar coated apple slices, bake into the buttery soft crust. We love that this apple rose tart is lightly sweet and completely irresistible.

    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <p><b> For Apple Tart Crust: </b></p>
    <ul>
       <li>1/2 cups all-purpose flour (186gr)</li> 
       <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (48 gr)</li> 
       <li>1/4 tsp salt</li> 
       <li>2 tsp baking powder</li> 
       <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled</li> 
       <li>1 large egg, chilled and beaten with a fork</li> 
       <li>1/3 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled</li> 
    </ul>

    <p><b> For Apple Filling: </b></p>
    <ul>
       <li>1 lb granny smith apples, peeled cored and thinly sliced</li>
       <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
       <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
       <li>1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter to dot the top</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps: </h2>
  <ol>
     <li>Preheat Oven to 375˚F and butter a 9″ springform pan. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour together with 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp baking powder.</li>
     <li>In a small bowl, beat 1 large egg well with a fork. Add 1/3 cup cream and stir until well blended. <br>
        Drizzle this mixture over the flour mixture and fold with a spatula just until it comes together. Do not overmix. Transfer dough in clumps to the buttered springform pan and spread it out evenly</li>
     <li>Peel, core and thinly slice apples (about 1/16″ thick). Transfer to a large mixing bowl. In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon then sprinkle over the apple slices and toss to combine.</li>
     <li>Right away, arrange slices in rings starting with the largest ones at the edges and working your way in, overlapping the slices halfway as you go. <br>
        Once there is only 1/2″ space is left in the center. Layer 3 of your thinnest apple slices in a long strip and roll them together to form a little rose and place it in the center. Dot the top with 1 1/2 Tbsp of butter and place the pan over a foil lined baking sheet to catch any stray apple juices then bake at 375˚F for 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
